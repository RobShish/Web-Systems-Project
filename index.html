        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website!
          I am a 19 year old from Sydney, Australia. Currently, I'm a computer science undergraduate student at UTS with aspirations to hone my skills as a software engineer upon graduation.

          I immerse myself in two particular forms of entertainment: video games and cars. My enthusiasm for the latter led me to join the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Car Society, a community that shares my love for enjoying and modifying their cars. </p>

        <h2>Website Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this website, you'll find my experience with computer science throughout my time in highschool, my own projects, and my future ambitions.
          I'll also have comments, and reflections on this website which will provide further insight in my thinking and rationale for certain features, design decisions, and more!
