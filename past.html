        <h2>Highschool</h2>
        <p>During highschool, I officially began my computer science journey in Year 9 where I chose the subject 'Information Systems Technolopgy', it sparked great interest in the subject, and I found myself suceededing in it. 
          I was then offered a spot in the 'Accelerated Information Process Technology' class where I was given the chance to sit and complete my HSC IPT class a year early.</p>
            
            <p>Some key takeaways from this experience were:</p>
            <ul class="dotpoint">
                <li>Building a database on Microsoft DB</li>
                <li>Building a website</li>
                <li>Focusing on the software development cycle</li>
                <li>Foundation of Networks</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>University</h2>
        <p>Continuing my computer science journey, I now find myself studying at UTS to further my education. During the first year of my university degree, I began my development in Java and Python.
          Having never fully immersed myself in these languages, I was eager to learn all that it offers.</p>
            
            <p>Some key takeaways from this experience were:</p>
            <ul class="dotpoint">
                <li>Learning and developing my Python and Java</li>
                <li>Improving my skills in software planning as a team</li>
                <li>Learning the theoretical mathematics of computer</li>
                <li>Learning the framework in which computers and networks are built upon</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <p>
            In my own freetime, I have used the knowledge I have learned thus far to create personal projects, from programming ingame weapons in GLua, to small scale Python scripts. 
            I have dabbled in a little bit of everything, and as my knowledge expands I aim to focus on making more projects in my freetime.
          </p>
            <p>Some key takeaways from this experience were:</p>
            <ul class="dotpoint">
                <li>How I am able to take my teachings from my education, and use it towards a hobby</li>
                <li>Playing around with different programs</li>
                <li>Giving myself a challenge and finding different ways to complete it</li>
                <li>Having a go at discovering new uses for my skills</li>
