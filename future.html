        <h2>Future Direction</h2>
        <p>
            Continuing my university studies, I plan to improve and develop my skills and knowledge, and fast track this through the use of an internship. 
            By learning from the people who already do what I hope to be doing, I can learn from their mistakes and their practices and implement them in my studies and future projects.
            I hope to start and achieve a successful career in the field of Software Engineering, and by doing something that I genuinely enjoy, I see myself taking my career far.

                <td>Back-end development means working on <span>server-side software</span>, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.</td>

                <td>A full stack developer is a web developer or engineer who works with <span>both the front and back ends</span> of a website or application. In this sense, they provide an end-to-end service, and can be involved in projects that involve databases and building user-facing websites.</td>
