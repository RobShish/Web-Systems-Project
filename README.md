<h1 align="center">Web Systems Project</h1>

This website was created for my final assignment in Web Systems. We were asked to create a website using HTML/CSS, ensuring we used all attributes and tags taught throughout the semester. We were then asked to create a comments page explaining our thought process to tackle three main aspects: aesthetics, technical, and accessibility.
